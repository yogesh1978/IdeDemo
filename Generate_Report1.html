The application leverages FastAPI for backend services, providing endpoints to handle user interactions, question management, and result compilation. The data is stored in JSON files, making it easily accessible and modifiable. The application is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment processes.\n \n### Features:\n \n1. **User Management**: Allows for adding, updating, and retrieving user information from a JSON file.\n \n2. **Questionnaire Handling**: Manages a series of questions related to car purchasing preferences, such as model, budget, and fuel type. Questions and their alternatives are stored and retrieved from JSON files.\n \n3. **Answer Submission**: Users can submit their answers to the questions, which are then stored in a JSON file linking users to their chosen alternatives.\n \n4. **Results Compilation**: Based on the answers submitted, the system compiles results and suggests cars that match user preferences, utilizing data from a dedicated JSON file.\n \n5. **Docker Integration**: The application can be run as a Docker container, which encapsulates the environment and dependencies, making it easy to deploy and scale.\n \n### Technical Specification:\n \n- **Backend**: The application is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.\n \n- **Data Storage**: Uses flat JSON files for storing data related to users, questions, alternatives, answers, and results.\n \n- **Testing**: Includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the API endpoints function as expected.\n \n- **Continuous Integration**: Utilizes CircleCI for continuous integration, automatically running tests and builds.\n \n- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose are used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The `Dockerfile` sets up the Python environment and installs dependencies, while `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates the setup of the application and any other necessary services.\n \n### File Groups:\n \n- **Backend**:\n \n  - `app/__init__.py`\n \n  - `app/api/api.py`\n \n  - `app/db/models.py`\n \n  - `app/main.py`\n \n  - `test/__init__.py`\n \n  - `test/test.py`\n \n- **Data**:\n \n  - `data/alternatives.json`\n \n  - `data/answers.json`\n \n  - `data/cars.json`\n \n  - `data/questions.json`\n \n  - `data/results.json`\n \n  - `data/users.json`\n \n- **Configuration and Setup**:\n \n  - `.circleci/config.yml`\n \n  - `.gitignore`\n \n  - `Dockerfile`\n \n  - `docker-compose.yml`\n \n  - `requirements.txt`\n \n- **Documentation**:\n \n  - `README.md`\n \n### Folder Analysis:\n \n**Project Root Folder:**\n \nPurpose: Serves as the primary container for all project-related files, organizing them into specific sub-folders based on their functionality.\n \n**Sub-Folders:**\n \n- **app**: Contains the core application code.\n \n  - `__init__.py`: Initializes the Python package.\n \n  - **api**: Contains the API logic.\n \n    - `api.py`: Manages data interactions for users, questions, and results.\n \n  - **db**: Handles data model definitions.\n \n    - `models.py`: Defines Pydantic models for validating data.\n \n  - `main.py`: Sets up the FastAPI application and routes.\n \n- **data**: Stores JSON files used as the database.\n \n  - `alternatives.json`: Lists alternatives for questions.\n \n  - `answers.json`: Stores user responses.\n \n  - `cars.json`: Contains data about cars.\n \n  - `questions.json`: Holds questions for the questionnaire.\n \n  - `results.json`: Compiles results of user choices.\n \n  - `users.json`: Manages user data.\n \n- **test**: Contains tests for the application.\n \n  - `__init__.py`: Initializes the test package.\n \n  - `test.py`: Includes tests for API endpoints.\n \n**Configuration and Setup Files:**\n \n- `.circleci/config.yml`: Configures CircleCI for continuous integration.\n \n- `.gitignore`: Specifies untracked files for Git.\n \n- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker container environment.\n \n- `docker-compose.yml`: Manages Docker services.\n \n- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies for the project.\n \n**Documentation Files:**\n \n- `README.md`: Provides setup and usage instructions.\n \nThis structure ensures that each component of the project is easily accessible and maintainable, facilitating effective development and deployment processes.\n \n\n Inspecting most important project files ...\n \n```json\n \n{\n \n  \"files\": [\n \n    \".circleci/config.yml\",\n \n    \"Dockerfile\",\n \n    \"README.md\",\n \n    \"app/main.py\",\n \n    \"app/db/models.py\",\n \n    \"docker-compose.yml\",\n \n    \"requirements.txt\"\n \n  ]\n \n}\n \n```\n \n\n Describing file .circleci/config.yml ...\n \n{\n \n    \"summary\": \"This YAML file configures continuous integration workflows for a project using CircleCI, specifically focusing on running unit tests in a Python environment.\",\n \n    \"detailedsummary\": \"The '.circleci/config.yml' file is a configuration file for CircleCI, a continuous integration and delivery platform.
